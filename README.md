# Fightboat Game
# How-To Run Fightboat

## Set-Up
Before doing anything else, ensure that you have done the following:
- Install node.js. Node can be installed from https://nodejs.org/en.
- Open a terminal in this folder (the top level directory) and run `npm install`. This will install some packages and complete required setup steps.
- Once this step completes successfully, you will be able to build, run, and test the game.


This implementation of fightboat comes in two parts: The Server, and the Client.

## The Server
The Server is the backend code that controls game state, match making, and player communications. Code for the Server can be found in the `back` and `back/server` folder. 

### We are currently hosting an instance of the server on render.com. You can use this server to play-test the current build, but if you make any changes to the server code you will need to either test __locally__ or switch to your own server instance.

#### Testing Locally
To run a local version of the server, open a terminal in this (the top level) folder and run `npm run server`. This will launch a local build of the server at https://localhost:5100. 
You can check to see if the server is running by visiting that url in any web browser and ensuring a page is displayed that says the server is operational.

For more information on the server, how to modify it, and what it does, please see the [Server README.md](./back/README.md) file.
The Server README file will also describe how to deploy your own branch of this repository to render.com to mimic our setup.


## The Client
The Client is the frontend code that displays the main menu, game board, and provides an area for the user to interact with. Our frontend visuals are constructed via html and css, and presented using Node.JS and electron.

Before you run the client, you will need to make some config changes depending on your testing setup:
CONFIG SCRIPT: [config.json](./front/assets/config.json) | ./front/assets/config.json

#### Testing Against Our Render Server:
- Edit the Config Script
- Set the "LiveServerAddress" value to "https://fightboat-q6f4.onrender.com"
- Set the "Build" value to "Live"
- Ensure that the "ClientId" value is set to `null`

#### Testing Against a Local Server
- Edit the Config Script
- Ensure that the "DevServerAddress" value is set to "http://127.0.0.1:5100"
- Set the "Build" value to "Dev"
- Ensure that the "ClientId" value is set to `null`

#### Testing Against Your Own Hosted Server:
- Use the same settings as testing against our Render server, but make sure you update the LiveServerAddress value to match your server's address.

### Running the Client
Once you have the client config.json updated, you can run the client by opening a terminal in this folder (the top level folder) and running `npm run play`. This will build and launch the game client.

### Testing Locally with Two Clients
If you want to test two clients locally (to play a match using a local server), you will need two terminals opened in this folder.
In the first terminal, run: `npm run play`
In the second terminal, run: `npm run play second`

This is necessary because of the way that we track clients. By specifying "second", the client will use a static 'config_dev.json' file instead of 'config.json', so that the ClientIDs will be unique.
If you run both clients using npm run play, without specifying second for one, the server will not be able to tell the two clients apart and that will result in match communication failure errors.

For more information and documentation on electron, the tool that allows us to display html/css/js as a native application, please see the project's official website at https://www.electronjs.org/. 


## Committing Changes
If you have tested locally, the ClientID in the config file will have been modified. To clean that up, we recommend running `npm run clean` before committing changes to your branches.
